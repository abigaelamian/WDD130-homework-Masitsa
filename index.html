        <p>My name is Abigail Malina Masitsa, and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. I am currently a student
            at Brigham Young University–Idaho, where I am studying Software Development. This is my
            first experience with web development, and I am committed to learning the skills
            necessary to succeed in this field.

            In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a wife and a mother, and I actively serve in
            various leadership roles in my church. I currently serve as the District Young Women
            President and the Branch Primary President. These responsibilities have strengthened my
            leadership, organization, and service skills.

            Alongside my university studies, I also attend a physical college where I am pursuing a
            Diploma in Computer Science. My goal is to graduate, build a strong career in
            technology, and use my skills to create meaningful and impactful digital solutions.</p>
