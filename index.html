        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="hello,my name is Abigail Malina Masitsa" width="100">

        <p>My name is Abigail Malina Masitsa, and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. I am currently a student
            at Brigham Young University–Idaho, where I am studying Software Development. This is my
            first experience with web development, and I am committed to learning the skills
            necessary to succeed in this field.

            In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a wife and a mother, and I actively serve in
            various leadership roles in my church. I currently serve as the District Young Women
            President and the Branch Primary President. These responsibilities have strengthened my
            leadership, organization, and service skills.

            Alongside my university studies, I also attend a physical college where I am pursuing a
            Diploma in Computer Science. My goal is to graduate, build a strong career in
            technology, and use my skills to create meaningful and impactful digital solutions.</p>

        <h2>Kenya Nairobi Temple</h2>
        <img src="images/templek.jpg" alt="the nairobi kenya temple">
        <p>The Nairobi Kenya Temple is a beautiful and sacred house of the Lord located in the
            capital city of Nairobi, Kenya. Its elegant design and peaceful surroundings make it a
            special place of worship and reflection. As one of the most important religious
            landmarks in the country, the temple stands as a symbol of faith, hope, and unity.

            For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the temple is a place
            where families are strengthened and eternal covenants are made. The Nairobi Kenya Temple
            has brought great blessings to Kenya by making temple worship more accessible to many
            people in East Africa. More than just a beautiful building, the temple represents God’s
            love and His plan for families and individuals.</p>
